# CPS_Twitter_Bot
Twitter script that tweets out screen shots of CPS energy map.

### Why
I figured this was a good way to begin the proccess of retreving data types from the site.

### What it does right now 
- Takes a screenshot of the site with the selenium chromedriver
- Crops the screenshot to just the map and map legend using PIL
- Posts the cropped image to twitter 

### What I want it to do 
- Scrape the form feilds of the website

- Only execute when the website is updated
